Configuring the CAN job values in your estimate builder involves setting up the pre-defined values for parts, labor, and total costs associated with each CAN job. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to configure these values:

Step 1: Access the Job Configuration Interface
Log in to the Estimate Builder: Access the estimate builder application using your credentials.

Navigate to Job Configuration: Look for a section labeled "Job Configuration" or "Manage CAN Jobs" in the admin or settings menu.

Step 2: Add or Edit CAN Jobs
Add New Job:

Click on "Add New Job" or a similar button.

Enter the name of the new CAN job (e.g., "CAN Job 1").

Edit Existing Job:

Select the job you wish to edit from the list of existing CAN jobs.

Step 3: Configure Parts Values
Enter Parts Details:

For each part (e.g., Roof Kit, Roof Membrane, SLF LVL DICOR, NON LVL DICOR, ROOF SCREWS, GLUE, Additional Parts), enter the quantity and cost.

Use the "Add Part" button if additional parts need to be included that are not listed by default.

Step 4: Configure Labor Values
Enter Labor Details:

Input the description of the labor required (e.g., "Repair Description").

Specify the number of hours required (Hrs) and the hourly rate (Labor/Hr).

Include any sublet costs or extras.

Enter the total labor cost, which can be calculated automatically based on the hours and rate if the system supports it.

Step 5: Configure Total Estimate
Calculate Total Estimate:

The system should automatically calculate the total estimate based on the parts and labor costs.

Adjust the total if necessary, especially if there are additional costs like shop supplies or tax that need to be included.

Step 6: Save the Configuration
Save Changes:

After configuring all the values, click on "Save" or "Update Job" to store the changes.

Confirm that the job details are correctly saved and displayed in the list of CAN jobs.
